  FastQC:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
      FastQC is a quality control application for high throughput sequence
      data. It reads in sequence data in a variety of formats and can
      either provide an interactive application to review the results of
      several different QC checks, or create an HTML based report which can
      be integrated into a pipeline.

     Versions:
        FastQC/0.11.5-Java-1.7.0_80
        FastQC/0.11.5-Java-1.8.0_74
        FastQC/0.11.5-Java-1.8.0_131
        FastQC/0.11.5-Java-1.8.0_162

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  For detailed information about a specific "FastQC" package (including how to load the modules) use the module's full name.
  Note that names that have a trailing (E) are extensions provided by other modules.
  For example:

     $ module spider FastQC/0.11.5-Java-1.8.0_162

  bcl2fastq2:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
      bcl2fastq Conversion Software both demultiplexes data and converts
      BCL files generated by Illumina sequencing systems to standard FASTQ
      file formats for downstream analysis.

     Versions:
        bcl2fastq2/2.19.1-foss-2016b-Python-2.7.12
        bcl2fastq2/2.20.0-foss-2016b-Python-2.7.12
        bcl2fastq2/2.20.0-intel-2017b-Python-2.7.14
        bcl2fastq2/2.20.0-Python-2.7.13

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  For detailed information about a specific "bcl2fastq2" package (including how to load the modules) use the module's full name.
  Note that names that have a trailing (E) are extensions provided by other modules.

  fastq_illumina_filter: fastq_illumina_filter/0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
      The recent version of Illumina's CASAVA pipeline (Version 1.8)
      produces FASTQ files with both reads that pass filtering and reads
      that don't. The new READ-ID (the @ line) contains many new fields,
      one of them indicates whether the read is filtered or not. This
      program can filter FASTQ files produced by CASAVA 1.8, and
      keep/discard reads based on this filter flag. 


    You will need to load all module(s) on any one of the lines below before the "fastq_illumina_filter/0.1" module is available to load.
